                Hi! I'm Adam, a front-end web developer with a passion for UI
                and UX design. When I'm not coding I spend my time working as a
                journalist for a Czech gaming medium
                <a href='components/About/AboutPage/AboutPage' target='_blank'>
                    {' '}
                    IndianTVCZ
                </a>
                . And lastly, I of course love to waste my time playing video
                games.
            </Typography>
        </>
